title: Collaborations with Evan
---

My son is a talented musician.   He started playing piano at the young age of 5.  He started playing drums at age 8 and he started playing double bass as part of his elementary school in grade 5.  He picks things up easily.

He's also quite interested in making his own music and you can find out more about him on his [website](https://ewpratten.com/music)

We have a couple collaborations up on the web and you can find them in my [discography](/Discography).   In one instance he took one of my amvient tracks and remixed it.  One a couple of other tracks, he's sent me a work-in-progress and I've added a little guitar.  

Over all it's a neat little connection with my son.
