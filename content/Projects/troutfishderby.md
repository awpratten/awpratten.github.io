Alex and I met through the [Magic Daffodils](/Projects/magicdaffodils).   I think it was pretty apparent quickly that there was some musical chemistry between us.   We've gotten together a few times to record at his studio and the music is fantastic.   Long ambient pieces that have movement.   Exactly the kind of music I like to play.

We have decided to release our music under the project name *Trout Fish Derby* which is a crazy name that has nothing to do with anything.

You can hear our music on [Bandcamp](https://troutfishderby.bandcamp.com/)
