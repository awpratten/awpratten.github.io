title: Magic Daffodils
---

Recently, I’ve been playing with a group that calls themselves the **Magic Daffodils**.  This is a casual group that is playing what I’d describe as free ambient noise.  The group includes drums, bass, electric violin, synthesizers and samples. 

For me it is an interesting opportunity.  While I have played in past situations where the music is mostly free noise the emphasis there was on loud.  My past groups have also had a sense of improvisation and live spontaneous but the music was constrained generally to something more melodic and ambient.   With the Daffodils, there is more of a free jazz element, which means playing with “big ears” and being prepared to play with or counter to what the others are bringing.
