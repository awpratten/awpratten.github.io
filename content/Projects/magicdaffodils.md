Since early in the COVID lockdowns, I’ve been playing with a group that calls themselves [Magic Daffodils](https://www.magicdaffodils.ca).  This is a group that is playing what I’d describe as free ambient-noise.  The group includes guitar, drums, bass, electric violin, synthesizers and samples.   All six members are veterans of the London music scene with backgrounds in the electronic, ambient, experimental, free jazz, and noise musics.


I love to play music and tend towards playing improvised, unscripted music. I am fortunate to be able to play with this group fairly regularly. For me it is an interesting opportunity.  While I have played in past situations where the music is mostly free noise the emphasis there was on loud.  My past groups have also had a sense of improvisation and live spontaneous but the music was constrained generally to something more melodic and ambient.  The music we play could be labelled noise music. The sound can be quite loud and chaotic at times. But at other times (possibly within the same piece) things might quiet down and some space develops. The music can almost veer toward ambiance. Playing this way really requires a lot of attention to what others are doing, selectively playing with or against. Visually I describe it as being like a rollercoaster with peaks and valleys, sharp turns, slow climbs, quick descents. As a musician, this is very challenging and at the same time there is a weird peace, almost like being in the eye of a hurricane. There is also a flow and an acceptance of what is right now. There is no point showing up with preconceived ideas. You don’t have to be concerned with anything that was just played and you also have no idea what will happen next. There is only now, this note, this pause, this moment.
