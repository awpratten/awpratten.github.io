I am a musician and composer. I am interested in creating music that apply textures, guitar effects, loops, found sounds, and accidental sounds.  While I am primarily a guitarist, I do dabble with other instruments such as double bass, my home made cajon, and piano.   I also do some music programming.

I have a sound, a tone, a music in my head that I am trying to express.  I know this isn't unique.  Most creative musicians will say the same thing.  

I've always had an interest in creating and recording music.   Even as a young teen, I was experimenting creating music using multiple cassette decks to simulate overdubbing.   Things changed significantly when I was able to purchase an early 4 track cassette recorder (Fostex X15).   I used that Fostex extensively to record both my own music as well as create demo tracks for area bands.

In addition to my own solo efforts I have collaborated with a number of different people over the years.   The most notable collaborations being Bits of Food (aka BOF), Baku, and Name with No Sound.

I am a member of the Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada ([SOCAN](http://www.socan.ca)).
